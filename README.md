# Spotify-Clone

In the course of acquiring coding skills, I successfully executed a project entailing the creation of a fundamental Spotify clone employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in front-end web development. The resultant web application is both responsive and user-friendly, providing users with the capability to play music. Design and styling of the interface were achieved through HTML and CSS, while JavaScript was utilized to manage user input and interactions, encompassing essential playback controls such as play, pause, and next. Additionally, this project afforded me valuable experience in utilizing version control tools like Git and GitHub. This documentation serves to provide insights into the development process and features implemented.
